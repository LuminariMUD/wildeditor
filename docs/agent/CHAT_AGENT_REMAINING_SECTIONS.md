Assistant: I'll help you create a mystical forest region. Let me check 
for existing connections to the Elven Sanctuary and then create the 
region with appropriate properties.

[Tool: search_regions - Finding Elven Sanctuary]
[Tool: check_lore - Verifying First Age references]
[Tool: create_region - Creating Mistwood Vale]

I've created "Mistwood Vale" at coordinates 150,200. The region features:
- Ancient elven ruins dating to the First Age
- Natural paths connecting to the Elven Sanctuary (147,198)
- Mystical properties including magical fog and ancient wards
- Generated description emphasizing the mystical atmosphere

Would you like me to add specific landmarks or adjust any properties?
