# 2. WILDEDITOR_API_KEY (use your existing backend API key)
# This should be the same key you use for your backend authentication

# 3. PRODUCTION_HOST (your server address)
# Example: 192.168.1.100 or myserver.com

# 4. PRODUCTION_USER (your SSH username)
# Example: root, ubuntu, ec2-user, etc.

# 5. PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY (your private SSH key)
# Copy the entire contents of your private SSH key file
# Example: contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa or your server's private key

# Note: Make sure these are added as SECRETS, not variables!
# The difference is that secrets are encrypted and not visible in logs.
